In doing so, the API should be easier and more consisstent, with new features by focusing on the modern implementation of Neuroglancer and the bleeding edge Spelunker deployment used in many CAVE projects. See the Changelog for more details.</p> <p>NGLui is a Python library to help interacting with Neuroglancer, a web-based viewer for large-scale 3D data visualization. Neuroglancer is designed to visualize large, 3d datasets, such as those found in connectomics, and <code>nglui</code> is designed to make it easier to generate and parse Neuroglancer states. It is particularly useful in the context of the CAVE analysis ecosystem, which provides tools for analyzing, proofreading and visualizing lage-scale connectomics data.</p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>To get the most out of NGLui (interacting with source info, uploading skeletons, and more), we suggest installing the full version of NGLui, which includes the <code>cloud-volume</code> dependency:</p> <pre><code>pip install nglui[full]\n</code></pre> <p>You can also install a more minimal version of NGLui without the cloud-volume dependency:</p> <pre><code>pip install nglui\n</code></pre> <p>However, note that cloud-volume is required for some features such as uploading skeletons and getting information about sources during state generation.</p>"},{"location":"#quick-usage","title":"Quick Usage","text":""},{"location":"#building-a-neuroglancer-state-directly","title":"Building a Neuroglancer state directly","text":"<p>Here, let's use the Hemibrain dataset information to build a Neuroglancer state.</p> <pre><code>from nglui import statebuilder\n\nviewer_state = (\n    statebuilder.ViewerState(dimensions=[8,8,8])\n    .add_image_layer(\n        source='precomputed://gs://neuroglancer-janelia-flyem-hemibrain/emdata/clahe_yz/jpeg',\n        name='emdata'\n    )\n    .add_segmentation_layer(\n        source='precomputed://gs://neuroglancer-janelia-flyem-hemibrain/v1.2/segmentation',\n        name='seg',\n        segments=[5813034571],\n    )\n    .add_annotation_layer(\n        source='precomputed://gs://neuroglancer-janelia-flyem-hemibrain/v1.2/synapses',\n        linked_segmentation={'pre_synaptic_cell': 'seg'},\n        filter_by_segmentation=True,\n        color='tomato',\n    )\n)\nviewer_state.to_link(target_url='https://hemibrain-dot-neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com')\n</code></pre> <p>This will return the link: Neuroglancer link.</p>"},{"location":"#building-a-state-from-cave-data","title":"Building a state from CAVE data","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Using CAVEclient with the MICrONs dataset is required for the following examples.

If you still need to support the older deployment, do not upgrade.</p> <p>Please read the new usage documentation! The main change is that it is now recommended to create states directly where possible, and there are now many more convenience functions. Instead of making a bunch of layer configs, now you make a <code>ViewerState</code> object and directly add layers and their information with functions like <code>add_image_layer</code>, <code>add_segmentation_layer</code>, and <code>add_annotation_layer</code>. Instead of always mapping annotation rules and data separately, you can now directly add annotation data through functions like <code>add_points</code> and then export with functions like <code>to_url</code>. You can still use the old pattern of rendering a state and mapping data with DataMap objects. A new \"pipeline\" pattern makes it more efficient to build complex states in a smaller number of lines of code.</p>"},{"location":"changelog/","title":"Changelog","text":"<p>This project attempts to follow Semantic Versioning and uses Keep-a-Changelog formatting.

Notably, Neuroglancer is designed to be a bit of complex Javascript that runs in your web browser and, generally, looks for data in various cloud-hosted locations. There are a number of different deployments of Neuroglancer, which can be based on slightly different versions of the code or slightly different configurations available. The two deployments that are built into NGLui right now are \"Mainline\" or the default deployment built from the main branch of Neuroglancer from Google and the Spelunker deployment based a bleeding-edge branch focused on CAVE-related features. Additional Neuroglancer deployments can be added using <code>site_utils</code>.</p> <p>Virtually every aspect of Neuroglancer is defined by this state, which is represented by a collection of keys and values in a JSON object that you can see if you click the <code>{}</code> button in the upper left of the Neuroglancer interface. Everything from selecting new objects or adding annotations to zooming or rotating your view is defined in this state, which can be imported or exported effectively as a readable <code>json</code> file. The complete description of the state is typically encoded in the URL, which is how you can easily share most Neuroglancer URLs. Building your own Neuroglancer view is thus simply the process of defining the state and passing it to a Neuroglancer viewer.</p> <p>The state has two main aspects, viewer options that define global properties like the position, the layout of views, and what tabs are open, and layers that define different datas sources and how they are visualized. Layers can be different types with different behaviors: Image layers show 3d imagery, Segmentation layers have \"segments\" with unique ids that can be selected and visualized in 3d with meshes or skeletons, and Annotation layers can show points, lines, or other objects associated with data. Each layer has a name, a source (typically a path to a cloud-hosted dataset), and various configuration options. Layers can actually have multiple complementary data sources of the same type, for example a Segmentation layer can have one source for segmentations and meshes while another source provides skeletons or segment property data. Unlike Image or Segmentation layers, Annotation layers can also have a \"local\" source, where the annotations are directly defined in the Neuroglancer state.</p> <p>The Statebuilder module follows this viewer-and-layer pattern, where you define a viewer with a set of options and then add layers of different types to it. Where possible, Statebuilder tries to tie components together as simply as possible and with reasonble defaults in order to make a Neuroglancer state with as little code as possible.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Current functionality is focused on viewing data. The many options for controlling the Neuroglancer interface are not yet implemented directly, although they are available in the underlying <code>neuroglancer</code> python library and JSON state.
