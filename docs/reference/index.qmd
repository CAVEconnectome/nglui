# Function Intro
This site provides basic documentation for the functions in `NGLui`.
Please see the [tutorials](../tutorials/index.qmd) for more information about how to use them.

Note that `nglui` spans two public submodules responsible for different tasks.

- `StateBuilder` handles data-driven Neuroglancer state generation (hence the package name).
- `Parser` extracts information from Neuroglancer states, as represented by dictionaries.
